HW Implementations:
- Thread syscalls + spinlocks + mutexes -> thread.c

Extracredit implementations:

- Conditional Variables 
  -> thread_lock_impl.h
    - created thread_sleep and thread_wakeup syscalls
    - implementations of struct q, thread_cond_init, thread_cond_wait, thread_cond_signal
  -> extracredit_cond_var.c
    - small test program that sends a message in a char buffer to the producer queue 
      which signals the reciever queue on receiving the message.
    - the receiver queue waits until there is a message in the queue and processes it once available

- Semaphores 
  -> thread_lock_impl.h
    - implementations of sem_init, sem_wait, sem_post
  -> extracredit_semaphore.c
    - small test program that creates a small queue of N=5 values
    - prod_work -> producer adds 5 values to the queue, counting semaphore increases
    - cons_work -> consumer dequeues values while there are elements in the queue

- Fix sbrk and malloc
  -> proc.c
    - Fixed only sbrk - growproc function
    - malloc not fixed
  -> extracredit_sbrk.c
    - small test program that creates 2 threads and calls sbrk twice
    - each sbrk requests for the amount of memory specified in the balance->amount variable
